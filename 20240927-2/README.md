63,300 board positions and their corresponding scores using games played by a turbostack prediction model.

mean=16875 (±1.0%), stdev=6760, best=30858, n=6330

10 board positions are taken from each game, which is why the stats above show a lower n=6330.

The scores are unscaled by level, here are the stats as they would appear in real L18 games:

mean=320625 (±1.0%), stdev=128440, best=586302, n=6330

(Lines are limited to 130, so this is like the transition score, although other constraints like not seeing the next piece also apply.)
