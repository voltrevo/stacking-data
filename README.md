# stacking-data

A place to put data related to training my [stacking AI](https://github.com/voltrevo/turbostack).

I think it's generally bad practice to include data in version control, so I'm putting it here instead (also version control but at least it's separate and using git lfs).

The nature of the data and its formats will evolve over time so each batch has its own directory and comes with some explanatory information.
